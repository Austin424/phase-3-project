### using my knowledge,online examples and ai to help smooth the rought edges, i made a pick your own adventure game purely in the CLI

## you get to choose between 3 classes your cliche RPG 3: Warrior, Rouge and Mage

#choice matters, each have access to a special attack but they require mana to use; the mage might be the weakest health and defense wise but  has access to much more manan than the others

#you get 3 health and mana potions so use them wisely cause at the end, you'll come face to face with the Big Bad Evil Guy
